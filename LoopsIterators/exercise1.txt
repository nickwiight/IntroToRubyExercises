Does .each return the last expression of the last loop of the block? In this case
it would return 6?

Nope. Returns the data given to it. In this case, the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

That does make more sense upon more thought. It returns self, which is the object
its being called on. That way if you mutate the object, you're returning the
mutated object.
