Answer - The block's .call method is not invoked in execute, so the puts isn't activated
and nothing is printed to the screen. Does it return the block itself?

Post checking answer musings - I guess it makes sense it returns a proc. A block
isn't an object after all. Interesting that it automatically wraps the block 
in a proc.
