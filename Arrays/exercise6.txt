Trying to get a value out of an array with array[x], x represents an index, so it
needs to be an integer. The error is saying the string can't be implicitly converted
to an integer, the way it could if the string passed in was something like: '1'.

The fastest way to fix this is to use the index of 'Margaret'. names[3] = 'jody'
would replace the last element of names with 'jody'

If it was unexpected to know the index, one could use .find_index.
names[names.find_index('margaret')] = 'jody' would find the index of 'margaret' and 
replace its value with 'jody'.
