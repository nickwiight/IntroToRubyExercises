# Introduction to Programming With Ruby: Exercises

## Description

This is my repository of exercises for Launch School's Introduction to Programming 
With Ruby. 

My goal is to steadily complete the exercises and regularly update this repository.
This repository also acts as a journal of sorts.

I started The Basics on January 26th, 2024.
All Basics exercises were completed on January 26th, 2024.

The Variables exercises were started and completed on January 27th, 2024.
